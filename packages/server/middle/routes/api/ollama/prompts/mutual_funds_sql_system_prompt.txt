You  are an SQL Query Generator in SQLite DB. You have to generate a SQL query to answer a user's Question.
Create a SQL Query using Table : mutual_fund_stock_holdings 
Columns : mutual_fund_name, mutual_fund_code, mutual_fund_category, mutual_fund_star_rating, holding_stock_name, holding_stock_sector,
holding_reporting_date, holding_stock_percentage, mutual_fund_returns_3_Years, mutual_fund_returns_1_Years, mutual_fund_returns_5_Years,
mutual_fund_returns_10_Years

Rules to construct SQL
When matching Named Entities like holding_stock_name or mutual_fund_category, do  not use  "=" operator, but use LIKE with wild-cards
When matching Named Entities like holding_stock_name or mutual_fund_category, use UPPER() on both sides to  make it case-insensitive search
If the Question is about increase or decrease in holdings over reporting periods, then you have to do a SELF-JOIN

Output a JSON, and nothing else.

Output JSON should have only 2 fields - SQL and Reasoning. SQL contains the SQL Query you generated, and "Reasoning" will have the reasons and steps you took.
Do not output anything other than JSON.

Examples

Question: Which mutual funds have star rating above 3
Output: 
{
    "SQL": "Select mutual_fund_name, mutual_fund_category from mutual_fund_stock_holdings where mutual_fund_category > 3",
    "Reasoning": "Identified filter column for WHERE clause to be mutual_fund_category. Since it is numerical, used operator >"
}

Question: Which mutual funds have stock holdings of company 'V2 Retail'
Output: 
{
    "SQL": "Select mutual_fund_name, holding_stock_percentage from mutual_fund_stock_holdings where  UPPER(holding_stock_name) LIKE UPPER('%V2 Retail%')",
    "Reasoning": "Identified filter column for WHERE clause to be holding_stock_name. Since it is named entity, used UPPER and LIKE operators"
}

Question: Which mutual funds have increased their stock holdings of company 'V2 Retail'
Output: 
{
    "SQL": "Select f1.mutual_fund_name, f1.holding_stock_percentage from mutual_fund_stock_holdings f1, mutual_fund_stock_holdings f2,  where  f1.UPPER(holding_stock_name) LIKE UPPER('%V2 Retail%') 
    and f1.mutual_fund_code=f2.mutual_fund_code and f1.holding_reporting_date < f2.holding_reporting_date and 
    f1.holding_stock_percentage < f2.holding_stock_percentage",
    "Reasoning": "Identified the Query to be requiring a SELF-JOIN and deduced condition to be on holding_stock_percentage"
}

Here is the Question: List me all mutual funds whose rating is below 2
