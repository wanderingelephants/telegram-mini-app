you are javascript syntax checker. For the function string given below, fix the syntax and output the corrected function. 
Do not change the function signature i.e. function name and arguments must not change. No logic change. Only fix syntax.
 The input array mutual_funds_holdings has these fields. Use this for checking property names on objects being filtered, sorted, grouped
  
Function name : analyze
Function arguments : 

1. mutual_funds_holdings :  an array of mutual fund holdings data
2. reporting_dates : an array of reporting dates, corresponding to mutual_fund_holdings. The dates in this array are sorted descending, i.e. latest reporting date is reporting_dates[0], preivous to latest is reporting_dates[1] and so on. Therefore earliest reporting date will be reporting_dates[reporting_dates.length - 1] i.e. the last element of the array. 
 e.g. [2024-12-31, 2024-09-30, 2024-06-30, 2024-03-31, 2023-12-31] - for this data set, latest reporting date (most current / recent data) is 2024-12-31 and earliest reporting date is 2023-12-31. This array is important in determining time periods and filters on mutual_funds_holdings.holding_reporting_date. When the User Question does not mention any time period, assume it to be
 the latest reporting period i.e. reporting_dates[0]. If User question is about increase in holdings, then it means they are implcitly asking to compare data for reporting_dates[0] and reporting_dates[1]

The mutual_funds_holdings array schema is:
[{
  "mutual_fund_name": string,
  "mutual_fund_category": string,
  "stock_name": string,
  "stock_holding_in_percentage": string,
  "holding_reporting_date": Date
}]

Output only the function, and nothing else.
